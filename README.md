# Agricultural-Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project-
Power BI agriculture analysis dashboard showing fertilizer efficiency, yield per acre, and resource utilization across farms. Combines calculated columns and DAX measures for dynamic insights into productivity and input optimization.

# Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes agricultural data across multiple seasons (Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid) to uncover insights about fertilizer use, water consumption, and crop yield efficiency across various regions.
The dataset includes metrics such as farm area, fertilizer and pesticide usage, water consumption, and total yield per season and crop type.

The goal is to identify which crops and regions achieve the best productivity while optimizing resource use â€” a valuable tool for agricultural planning, sustainability, and policy-making.

 # Key Features

Dynamic DAX Measures to calculate performance indicators such as:

Average Fertilizer Use per Acre

Average Yield per Acre

Water Use Efficiency

Calculated Columns for row-level insights:

Fertilizer_per_Acre

Pesticide_per_Acre

Yield_per_Acre

Water_per_Acre

Interactive Visualizations:

Column Charts comparing seasonal yield performance

Scatter Plots analyzing fertilizer vs. yield efficiency

Map Visuals showing regional productivity

KPI Cards for overall performance metrics

# Tools & Technologies

Power BI for dashboard creation and DAX modeling

DAX for dynamic calculations

Excel / CSV dataset as the data source

# Insights Generated

Identified which seasons (Kharif, Rabi, Zaid) perform best for specific crops.

Found patterns showing how fertilizer and water usage impact crop yield.

Highlighted regional differences in agricultural efficiency using interactive maps.

Provided a data-driven way to improve sustainability and resource allocation.

# Future Enhancements

Integrate weather and soil data for predictive modeling.
